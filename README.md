# Hello, I'm Brianna Lynn Wimer! 👋

I'm a third Ph.D. student at the University of Notre Dame, pursuing my degree in the Computer Science and Engineering program under the guidance of my advisor, Dr. Ronald Metoyer. I'm extremely grateful for the opportunity to advance my knowledge in such a prestigious institution.

## My Research 🎓

My research focuses on Human-Computer Interaction and Accessibility. I'm passionate about understanding, designing, and developing technologies that can improve the lives of those who are blind or have low vision. I aim to create accessible interactive systems for data visualizations, enhancing their understanding and communication capabilities. 

## My Goal 💡

The end goal of my research is not just to produce new knowledge, but to use this knowledge to make a tangible, positive impact on people's lives. By making data visualizations more accessible, I hope to empower individuals who are visually impaired, giving them new ways to explore, understand, and interact with data in the digital world.

## Let's Connect! 🌐

I'm always open to discussing my research, potential collaborations, or opportunities to contribute to other projects. Feel free to reach out if you think we could do great things together.
